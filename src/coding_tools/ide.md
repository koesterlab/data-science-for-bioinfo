# integrated development environments (IDEs)

If all you want to do is done in `R`, your best choice of IDE is probably [`Rstudio`](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).
For all other purposes, you will have to look around and try what works for you.

## Microsoft Visual Studio Code

[VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) offers a lot of plugins for all common languages, plus lots of useful plugins for other stuff (and all for free).
It has [extensive documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), but the best way to get started is probably to simply [download VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and jump right in.
Several people in our group currently use it, with the possibility to [work on a remote project on a server via ssh](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) a very useful and heavily used feature.

## Jet Brains

Jet Brains develops a [suite of IDEs for different languages](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/#type=ide-vs) (just use the language filter on the right) and offers a [free version for academic purposes](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).
