# grammar of graphics

> Basically, a grammar of graphics is a framework which follows a layered approach to describe and construct visualizations or graphics in a structured manner. 

This is how Dipanjan Sarkar puts it in his [introduction to the grammar of graphics on towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149).
While the most popular implementation of this concept is in the [`ggplot2` package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (part of the `tidyverse` in `R`), implementations in other languages have followed.
For example, the above linked blog post uses [the python implementation in the package `plotnine`](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
