# Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a good language to write (bioinformatics) software in, with a focus on efficiency and reliability.
You will be able to analyze large (bioinformatics) data sets very quickly, with inherently safe memory management and easy parallelization.
It has [extensive documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) and a very active [user community](https://www.rust-lang.org/community).

## learning Rust

The language website already has a lot of resources, for example:

* [Getting Started with Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
* [Learn Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn), with all of the "official" learning materials
* the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/), for trying out code in an interactive browser session

And then, there is a public 4-day course for learning Rust, called ["Comprehensive Rust"](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/).
While this does require that you already have some programming experience and is originally meant as a course to be taught, you can nevertheless work through it at your own pace.
