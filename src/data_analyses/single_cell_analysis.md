### Moscot

[Moscot](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08453-2) is an extremely versatile framework for Optimal Transport (OT) applications in single-cell genomics. It scales to large datsets and can be used for a variety of applications across different modalities.
This includes trajectory inference, mapping expression to spatial data, aligning spatial transcriptomics slides, and integrating modalities (e.g. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq).
