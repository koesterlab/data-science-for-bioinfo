# YAML syntax

> YAML is a human friendly language for the communication of data between people and computers.
> The language is rich enough to represent almost any conceivable data structure or object inside a running computer program, as a readable plain text file. This type of language is often called a “serialization language” and YAML is definitely one of those.
> But unlike most serialization languages, the YAML format tries hard to make simple things really simple.

This is how the [YAML data project](https://yaml.com/) puts it, and it's spot on.
Thus, for anything where we need configuration files that should be readable by both humans and machines, we use the YAML language.
