# Data formats and tools

This section gathers common bioinformatics data formats, where you can find specifications of them and which tools you can use to handle them sanely.

## bioconvert: converting between bioinformatics file formats

There's a plethora of bioinformatics file formats, and you often need to convert from on to another.
[`bioconvert`](https://bioconvert.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) is a tool that integrates as many of these conversions as possible.
It's a community effort, so feel free [to contribute a converter](https://github.com/bioconvert/bioconvert/issues/1) if the one you need doesn't exist, yet, but you found (or implemented) a tool that can do it.
