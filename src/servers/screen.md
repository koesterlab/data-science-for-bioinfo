# persistent screen sessions

[`screen`](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html) is a tool that allows you to set up persistent `bash` sessions on a server (or another computer) that can continue to run when you log off / disconnect from them and that can have multiple windows (shell session) open at once.

## Getting Started

The bare essentials are described in [this **How To Use Linux Screen** guide](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/).
And this [**`screen` Quick Reference**](https://aperiodic.net/screen/quick_reference) gives you the most important command line arguments and keystrokes.
