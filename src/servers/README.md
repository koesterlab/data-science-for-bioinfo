# Working on servers

This section collects resources that are helpful for working on servers.
For example [how to log into servers via `ssh`](./ssh.md), [how to create persistent shell sessions](./persistent_shell.md) so that you can leave things running when you have to log out, and [how to get data onto and off of servers](./data_transfer.md).
