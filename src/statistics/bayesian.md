# bayesian statistics

You want a basic understanding or intuition of bayesian statistics (as opposed to frequentist statistics)?
The presentation [**Bayesian Statistics (a very brief introduction)**](https://faculty.washington.edu/kenrice/BayesIntroClassEpi2018.pdf) by Ken Rice could be a good starting point.

## learning bayesian statistics with R

There is [**Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling**](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/) by Alicia A. Johnson, Miles Q. Ott, and Mine Dogucu.
They provide a thorough introduction to bayesian statistics, all with excercises in `R` (even including their own dedicated `R` package `bayesrule` to accompany the book).

A slightly shorter introduction to bayesian statistics in R can be found in the [**Bayesian statistics** chapter](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/bayes.html) of the book [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/) by Danielle Navarro.
It is aimed at a psychology audience, but the examples should all be generic enough to follow.

Or you could check out this [**Bayesian models in R**](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/05/bayesian-models-in-r-2/) `r-bloggers` post by Francisco Lima.
It also has R code to follow along.

## learning bayesian statistics with python

You would rather learn bayesian statistics using python?
Look no further, here's [**Think Bayes 2**](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkBayes2/) by Allen B. Downey.
It comes with a Jupyter Notebook per chapter, so you can directly run (and play with) the code in the book.

## Causal inference and Bayesian statistics
[Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/) has a nice introduction to causal inference and applying it to Bayesian methods called [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919). It is also available as a set of [lectures on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus), updated annually. There is also an R package `rethinking` to go with the book.
