# If necessary, you can exclude one or more links from being checked with a
# list of regular expressions. The regex will be applied to the link href (i.e.
# the `./index.html` in `[some page](./index.html)`) so it can be used to
# ignore both web and filesystem links.
#
# Hint: you can use TOML's raw strings (single quote) to avoid needing to
# escape things twice.
